      # Why are we installing two Rust toolchain versions below?
      # answer: the rustfmt project is disfunctional, and chooses
      # to make many of its useful features only available if you run
      # a nightly toolchain (even though those features themselves are
      # many years old now). The recommended workaround is to install
      # both the toolchain version you want to use, and also the nightly
      # toolchain, just to be able to run "cargo +nightly fmt" to get the
      # full, very old set of rustfmt functionality.
