# Diem Rust SDK

### Installing Rust SDK

Diem provides an official Rust SDK in the [Diem-core GitHub](https://github.com/aptos-labs/diem-core/tree/main/sdk) repository. To use the Rust SDK, add the following dependency on the git repo directly, like this:

```toml
diem-sdk = { git = "https://github.com/aptos-labs/diem-core", branch = "devnet" }
```

The source code for the official Rust SDK is available in the [diem-core GitHub repository](https://github.com/aptos-labs/diem-core/tree/main/sdk).

## Using Rust SDK

See the [Developer Tutorials](../tutorials/index.md) for code examples showing how to use the Rust SDK.
