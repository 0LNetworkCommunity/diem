# Install the Diem CLI

The Diem command line interface (CLI) helps you develop apps, debug issues, and operate nodes. See [Use Diem CLI for Configuration](../diem-cli-tool/use-diem-cli.md) for all possible uses.

You can install the Diem CLI as a pre-compiled binary:

* [Install the Diem CLI by script](./automated-install.md) - Recommended for Linux and Windows. MacOS is also supported.
* [Install the Diem CLI with Homebrew](./install-from-brew.md) - Recommended for MacOS.
* [Download the prebuilt Diem CLI binaries](./download-cli-binaries.md) - Ensures you get a stable version of the Diem CLI built on a regular cadence from the `main` upstream development branch.

You can also [build the Diem CLI from source code](./build-from-source.md). This allows you to build from any of the Diem branches, including `devnet`, `testnet`, `mainnet`, and the latest code in `main`, the development branch.

## (Optional) Installing the Move Prover
Optionally, you can [install the Move Prover](./install-move-prover.md).
