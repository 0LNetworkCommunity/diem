# Contribute to the Diem Ecosystem

We welcome your own [contributions](https://github.com/aptos-labs/diem-core/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) to the [Diem](https://diemfoundation.org/currents) blockchain and this site! Diem exists to foster an inclusive ecosystem. This page describes ways you can help, while the other pages in this section highlight our community's contributions.

As always, adhere to the [Diem Code of Conduct](https://github.com/aptos-labs/diem-core/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) when taking part in our ecosystem.

## Ask questions and offer answers

Join [Diem Discord](https://discord.gg/diemnetwork) to speak with developers and hop into the Diem community. It's the best way to keep up to date with news and developments in the Diem universe. Be sure to check pinned messages in the channels - this is where we like to post topic-specific links, events, and more.

For technical questions, we recommend [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/diem) so anyone in the world may search for, benefit from, and upvote questions and answers in a persistent location. To offer your own advice and find tips from others, post to and use the [Diem Forum](https://forum.diemlabs.com/).

Please remember, community managers will never message or DM you first, and they will never ask you to send them money or share any sensitive, private, or personal information. If this happens to you, please report it to us in [Diem Discord](https://discord.gg/diemnetwork).
